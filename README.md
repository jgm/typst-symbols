# typst-symbols

This package provides definitions of the symbols used in typst
(<https://typst.app>).  (Currently version 0.12.0 is targeted.)

It exports lists of triples, which can be converted into maps or
other more appropriate forms, depending on the use case.  Each
triple contains the symbol name (Text), a Boolean that is True
if the symbol is an accent, and the resolved symbol (Text).

The symbols can be updated by scraping the typst website:
`make update` will do the work.
